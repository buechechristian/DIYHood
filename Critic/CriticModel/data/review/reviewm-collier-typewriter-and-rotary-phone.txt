Perhaps the artist anticipates and ironizes overzealous fascination with technology. In my understanding of these pieces, the interplay of language and its parts with the cumbersome machines that contain it, or even enclose it, reinvigorates the dispute of humanities versus technology, and which will bring the progress we may have gotten accustomed to expect. In a way, the temporality of the devices underscores the vigor of technological progress. Some machines die — new ones appear. We do not see, however, the new generation depicted, it is but implied. It is the letters, either black on white or white on black, vivid and always relevant, that remain active as the only working and still usable components in these devices; words, unlike machines, will never fail those who use them — regardless even of time itself.
