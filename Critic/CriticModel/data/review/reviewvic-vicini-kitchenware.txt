They remind me of old school hand drawn and painted animation, from the fifties, only with more luster and zest. And there is something naive and traditional about them, in the best meaning of these words — a warm reminder of domestic familial comfort. Straightforward and clean compositions entertain the eye without diverting it to unnecessary elaborations, and manifest disarming honesty. This still life is both a celebration of unpretentiousness and an ingenuous indulgence in the abundance of light and color — good life, some would say.
 
However, I would like to return to the reflections, as some of them present an endless source of marvel. Near hallucinatory distortions of line and color will hypnotize the susceptible viewer… well, maybe. Contrary to the common belief that staring at the kettle won’t make it boil quicker, getting lost in these colorful swirls can prove to be an effective time machine, transferring us right to the boiling point. (The click or the whistle terminates the stupor… not to worry). Eventually, in pieces where all of the mentioned qualities intermix particularly harmoniously, reaching a critical mass, the master definition of a “classic” emerges as eminently suitable, many other works being very close to that description.
