Color virtually vibrates, implying temporal progression; pieces depicting sunrise and sunset, when shifts in time become particularly highlighted,  further underscore the sense of passing time. Composition is minimal: Monet would paint only one or two haystacks, and avoid monotony by stressing perspective. The stack in front either dwarfs its kin, or breaks its form by partially covering it. While the inherently stationary nature of these scenes seems to contrast with the rhythm of 
Interplay of light and shadow often splits individual haystacks into simpler (easily visually manageable) geometrical forms; when light is scarce, the snow “performs” the same task, covering only the side facing the wind, effectively delineating triangles and trapezoids. The long rectangles of the shadows also contribute to this geometric dance.
Could the close attention the artist paid to the relationship between colored geometrical forms — focusing on their juxtapositions in nature — have carried the seeds of abstraction? Several decades later, such painters as Kandinsky and Malevich removed all links to figurative subject-matter, identifying differently colored planes (triangles, trapezoids, complex irregular shapes) as a painterly theme in its own right. Perhaps, in a way, Monet anticipates the thematics of abstract painting in his haystacks.
