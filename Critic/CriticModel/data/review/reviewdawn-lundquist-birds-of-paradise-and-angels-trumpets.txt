It  appears to trickle down from the petals and paint the air; the flowers seem to be sweating hue, so thick and generous are the patches of deep blue, red, white and orange. Usually only two or three main colors constitute the entire palette; they interchange and create intense compositions (usually relying on radial symmetry).
As it often happens when color takes precedence, the painterly vanquishes nearly all traces of the linear. These are the antidote to a botanical illustration: the emphasis here is on the unified whole, on the movement of humid air that soaks the painted surface and on a mystical luminescence that all but evokes mythical contemplation on the emergence of life. Unusual viewing angles and an unclear generic status — in most cases it is impossible to determine whether the flowers are still life or still growing — contribute to the mystical mood. Furthermore, the lack of detail disrupts scale perception and the flowers may appear like giants slowly moving through air. Everything seems to conspire to convey something magical.
In a contrary turn, these florals succeed also in something more real and tangible: the depicted richness overstimulates the visual perception as to overflow and arouse, if only in one’s mind, other senses — particularly the sense of smell. The Angel’s Trumpet you see above may seem to spread faint tinkling and accompany its heavenly ambiance. Regardless of one’s readiness to accept such interpretation, ignoring the sensuous abundance — naturally predisposed to engage other senses — would be unfair. These flowers want to smell and sound — and who are we to stop them?
