To capture vast space without overloading the viewer, the artist keeps things simple in terms of composition and color. I think these choices benefit the theme: hue harmony and compositional flow take precedence over small detail in panoramic landscapes, and particularly so in small paintings. Yet there are subtle elaborations, sophisticated color overlaps and gradations that reveal a tendency towards maximal precision. As a result, I found myself struggling to make out the buildings from the town contours, and the trees behind the meadow (the painting below). By giving the viewers the impression that they indeed could, the artist may have achieved his main goal.
To conclude this series of reviews of Frank Gardner’s work, I would like to say that I find his use of light, though at times harsh for viewing, emotionally exhilarating. Thematically, some of his Mexican farm paintings exhibit a gentle romantic pastoral streak (when the workers appear from afar, moving away from the viewer) , while others are more realist (when they work right in front of the audience, moving towards it). Finally, his work displays such a clear compositional vision and unity of design that if asked to describe it in just a few words, I would say: “He always gets his point across.”
