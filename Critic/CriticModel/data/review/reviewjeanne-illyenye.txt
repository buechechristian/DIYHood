I would like to discuss one of the most explored subjects by the artist, the florals. In some ways, Jeanne Illenye’s floral pieces are the least characteristic of her style. The extreme close ups deviate from the pattern of bouquets presented at a distance so calm we ignore it; here the proximity becomes one of the active principles of the composition, one to be reckoned with, rather than dismissed as an auxiliary technical/geometrical aspect to the painting as a whole. Such proximity inevitably invites close inspection, analysis and conclusion making — every stage being inherently suffused with considerable intensity. The dark, often black backgrounds increase the tension even further.
Still, it is important to emphasize that these frictions occur within the definitive framework of global calm and control, being unable to break through and establish some kind of chaos. Though, I must admit, sometimes it feels pretty close to the verge — just another addition to that tension, this time from the aspect of formal evaluation. Overall, the florals exposed with the zoom in (botanical) effect, and the more serene ones fill in the niche to its utmost limits. The artist proves her mastery of the field  by exhibiting superb technical execution, as well as by the effortless transition from one sub-genre to another, — eliciting admiration for both.
