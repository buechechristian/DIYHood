Painting only replicates restoration, just as art imitates life, but in this particular case, the common cause of paying a tribute to the theme brings the two spheres closer together. I think that a series of paintings does even further in that direction: almost every piece focuses on a single detail or part, as if recording an actual restoration in progress. Surely that would be a very laborious recording (compared to photography, for instance) but, surprisingly, it would make sense — everything about these cars is excessive — and such an artistic finale brings about a logical conclusion to the mechanical melodrama.
 
 
In conclusion I would like to discuss how composition here differs from the artist’s food and other still life works. If in those paintings he sought to include and unify, here the objective is almost proportionally opposite. The close-ups exclude the rest of the body and, they literally exclude the uninitiated (consolidating the camaraderie of the experts). He lingers on the separate parts in a display of what I find no other term for but “analytical painting,” so elaborate and accurate is the rendering. Indeed, the next step for the viewer would be to “induce” the entire car from the depicted detail. And is there a more direct way to engage our imagination
