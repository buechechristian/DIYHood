Artistic logic is similarly visible in the choice of background color: deep brown reiterates the hue of the chocolate, while the bright lilac that of the filling. The totality of repetition calls up the richness of the flavor, seeking to allude to taste through color. In a delicious turn, the taste doesn’t retrace to the same palette: in my mind, the flavor of the sweet stuff transcends into silver sparks and stars, and bright blue swirls, all on a background of golden foil — the artist avoids monotony through the power of individual association. In a way, the painter capitalizes on our past experiences, aiming at them, and making the paintings a kind of a subconscious conduit to previous tastings.
Chocolate is a known afrodisiac, and the above painting conveys that quality in a most subtle, or straightforward — depending on the viewer — manner. The bitten, half melted bonbon implies the tasting of a fruit of a different kind, and the tempting berry inside may prompt to extend the metaphor even further (the chocolate compartment indeed appears to guard it from some impatient sweet tooth). The reddish tones may suggest blushing or the rushing of blood to other body parts… Anyway, we sometimes tend to associate red and its varieties with sexual thoughts and actions. I think that the general warm atmosphere encourages erotic fantasies — after all, it is in our blood, which, as it happens, is also red.
