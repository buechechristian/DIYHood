As fits such themes, the paintings rely on humor for thematic interest: the slant threatens to knock the crab off its feet and put the critter in a comic — for us — situation. The fishes, swimming around in a crowd, appear in a funny pattern that is both familial and familiar. The high viewing angle allows us to absorb the rich oranges. Despite the sea setting, the artist gives us an aquarium simulation.
I like these pieces for their harmony and their light, summery feel. The word “effortless” gets thrown about a lot recently, but there is definitely a dash of that ease here — achieved, no doubt, with considerable effort. The artist finds points of interest and complex shadow without making them the sole focus of the compositions. These paintings are about the waves — of water, of sand, of light. Holly Lombardo aptly condensed the warmth and spirit of summer into several sunny watercolors.
