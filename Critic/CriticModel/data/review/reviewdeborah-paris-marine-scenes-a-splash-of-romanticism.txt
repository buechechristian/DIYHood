There is some restrained irony in how the bustle recedes as we enter the open sea. Strangely enough, the transition does not reduce the tension but only anchors it by waves of unpredictability, imparted by the dirty blue-grays. Moreover, the spray and foam that carried the light in the foreground descend, disappear and eventually transform into fog in the back. As a consequence, the vivacity and swirling is lost, and the audience is left with an unexpected cold visual application, as if a pictorial “wake up and back to reality” call. I think that this transition may bear the metaphorical connotation of the loss of innocence and the shift from adolescence to adulthood — two inherently romantic notions.
So if I were to try and categorize these paintings stylistically, I would careen strongly towards romanticism. Surely they are all-rounder than that, otherwise the artist’s intent mentioned at the outset would not bear a single sea cucumber. But there is something over the top — romantic — in these scenes that is difficult to ignore, the whole elemental struggle scenario that works its way from exposition to epilogue with admirable perseverance. And, it is as refreshing as a breath of Mediterranean sea breeze in a warm May morning.
