 Space also crystallizes through the dissections, through similar indirect, though perhaps more concrete influence. Simply by slicing the objects — or including them partially — the artist implies that they are the disposable occupants of the room, and that the space they fill bears precedence. Interestingly, the included parts often form an approximate circle, surrounding… nothing, that is, space. Furthermore, the corners of the rugs, the seat-back, the chest, the bed, the window, they all tend to point towards the center, the empty space. Even the window curtain, tied and sliced, seems to try to embrace the air, all the while freeing the view into the greater space outside. I will risk a tautology and state that space needs space, and that the compositional device of pulling objects outside the frame provides it.
And here’s a look at the artist’s studio. This photo is from
