Just imagine any of these paintings in an impressionistic reincarnation — absurd, and a painterly misnomer. I think that the popularity of photo and hyper-realism discloses the wish to contemplate reality at its most pronounced while retaining an honest aesthetic and artistic framework. Additionally, this trend offers an adequate response to television and photography; it acknowledges their influence, yet assimilates rather than imitates. On the one hand, it proves that it can do “just as good,” and on the other keeps on renovating painting by continuous exchange of ideas with other art forms.
 
 
To return to more technical aspects of Todd’s art, I would like to mention the scrupulous and incredibly (credibly, that is) accurate treatment and distribution of color. The brown flirts with black, red, gray and white, and its own range is exceptionally wide, the additional colors either deepening or diluting the original hue. The ensuing variety, backed by the irregular configuration, provides an unlimited source of entertainment. The green bottle piece displays similar qualities, with cooler tones. Putting all symbolism aside, these paintings are first and foremost technical masterpieces — and should be known as such above all.
