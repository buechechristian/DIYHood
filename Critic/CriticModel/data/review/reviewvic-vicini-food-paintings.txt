The theme calls for a parcelling to smaller and more numerous objects, and a complication of  composition inevitably ensues. Retaining unity becomes a more demanding, if not a burning challenge; I think that the artist recognizes and stands up to it gracefully and, which might be even more important, discreetly. He doesn’t aim at radical stylistic overhaul but builds up a generic change by fine tuning, gradually creating an alternative set of painterly principles (involving angle, tint variation and other parameters), perfected for these kinds of subjects.
 
 
It would be interesting to follow a shift in an opposite direction in the artist’s car paintings, where he concentrates on a single detail of the bigger image. Here I would like to restate that reaching these conclusions would be impossible without browsing Vic’s extensive library of reproductions on his websites. I am very enthusiastic about the benefits of publishing artwork on the Internet and would like to encourage artists to start art blogs. It is never too late. And it is not incidental that Vic’s blogs were named a “studio” and a “gallery” — because it is precisely what they are, allowing an in-depth inquiry into various aspects of his artistic process.
