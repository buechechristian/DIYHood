The notion of weight extends to the backgrounds too. The ethereal flowers accord with abstract airy atmosphere, but the fruits need to actually lie on something. The artist chooses a basic setting resembling a wall and floor (or table) conjunction, with linear and angular characteristics which complement the globular forms of the objects without overpowering the latter. The dark gray bluish tones consume all the light, leaving a few dashes for the still life — but eloquent, central dashes. Overall, the fruits and vegetables appear to lay in a nook, or a lair, a stylized environment evidently composed by the artist. The focus in these paintings is on the relationship between the various subjects rather than between them and the background.
General color schemes are bolder: exotic red-black and yellow-green combinations enliven the quiet compositions. Although the florals display powerful tonal clashes (such as the opposing reds and greens), the human eye tends to ignore the green of the stems and leaves and focuses on the bright blooms. Perhaps we are not unlike insects, tempted by the flowers’ brightness, — only we bring death by plucking them whereas the insects bring life by pollinating them. Here the colors declare the strong sweet or sour taste of fruits that were meant to be plucked. In some ways, SINH’s still life reclaims some of the zest lost in melancholic flowers.
