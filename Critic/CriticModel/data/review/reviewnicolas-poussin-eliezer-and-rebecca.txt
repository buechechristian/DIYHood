In order to tie this long horizontal composition together, Poussin cements it with a matrix of arms and amphorae. Arms, usually white or pinkish in tone, appear here and there, creating a chaotic scheme that evokes a sense of bustle, an almost auditory experience. Eliezer’s hand offers the gifts in an inconspicuous fashion, and blends with this general trend. The amphorae, however, appear in a more or less equal intervals, and impart a sense of rhythm that acts as a compositional glue of a different sort.
Architectural motifs play a background role, though unlike in The Judgment of Solomon, they interact with objects in the foreground. For instance,  Eliezer’s turban, the attribute of his masculinity, is repeated in the marble ball. While Eliezer communicates his interest to Rebecca – the topic of their discussion being masculine-feminine relations – the large marble ball overlooks the young ladies on the right, perhaps disclosing their line of thought.
