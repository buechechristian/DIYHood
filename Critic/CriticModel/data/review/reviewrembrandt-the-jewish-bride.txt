The faces of the couple seem to glow by themselves: Rembrandt uses light beyond its painterly purpose, as a tool that describes the inner state of the protagonists. Light travels from above, first sculpting and penetrating their faces, and then bounces back, impregnated with the story of the young man and the woman.
The composition is fairly classical in its triangular pyramid shape. The hands of the actors constitute the most physically animated part of the scene and evince complex symmetry; these body parts play an ornamental compositional role, decorating the otherwise simplified, static event. The garments, though rich and festive, cannot vie with the subtlety and subdued richness of the facial expressions and, in fact, seem to sit uncomfortably on the wearers.
A realistic, painterly display of light and shadow, a less rigid (even if static) composition, and a general shift towards intimacy and individualization — all these stand principally against the grand spiritual generalizations of the Renaissance, which are all but abandoned in this piece. In choosing to depict a Jewish rather than Christian bride — Judaism being much more pragmatic and down-to-earth in matters of matrimony — Rembrandt found the perfect theme to express his own vision of Baroque painterly principles.
