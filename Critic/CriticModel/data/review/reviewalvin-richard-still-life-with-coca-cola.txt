Eventually the artist reinforces the boundary between the natural experience of aesthetic appreciation and its artificial commercial exploitation, no matter how sophisticated. Where business blurs, art distinguishes. On a different note, I find that these pieces hold the potential to explode, just like a coca-cola bottle opened after a few shakes. During the two stages the artist shakes ideas, only to show how incompatible (like the red sign near the piece of sky) they can be. In a somewhat ironical finish, he directs the paintings at the viewer, contradictory to the instructions for use usually printed on the bottles’ label. Art, unlike carbonated beverages, explodes only metaphorically.
On the other hand, this is not a call for revolution, but a careful, even stoic study of the current state of events. By his creative effort the artist repackages commercial ideas and presents them to the public again, but on his own terms. He doesn’t offer false hope, reveling in the idea of regaining lost innocence — and there is nothing sarcastic about these paintings. Rather, he buoys the issue with a reserved attitude and gently reminds us that just as the pleasure derived from watching still life can transcend the subject, the pleasure of life can overcome any commercial purpose that tries to abduct it.
