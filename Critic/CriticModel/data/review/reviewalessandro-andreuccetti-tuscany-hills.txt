The watercolors may at times seem unpredictable, and bubbly, in the most literal meaning of the word. The two purple paintings include bubbles in various forms, some reminding of defects appearing on old black and white films and daguerreotypes — here we are, back to photography again. Anyhow, either small or big, they conjure the ghosts of pointillism, but with an original twist. The final result amounts to several layers of color being superimposed, once again contributing to depth and varied rendering of space. In simple words, I think that what makes these paintings so interesting is that yes, we can look at the trees, — but we can also look between them.
Though the artist’s original intention was to depict the hills in various seasons during the course of one year, he appears to have leaped back to much more distant eras. Some of the trees bear a resemblance to mesozoic tree-ferns. If it weren’t for the path dissecting the ground in one of the pieces, the illusion of ancient wilderness would have been perfect. But perhaps the artist was aware of that quality: the exotic viewing angles, and compositions involving close ups and panoramic views shake the onlooker up, in a very primitive (basic) and violent way, prompting associations with the dawn of civilization and the beginning of life on our planet. And thus, the series as a whole work as a kind of a force of nature — and, most of all, — of human nature.
