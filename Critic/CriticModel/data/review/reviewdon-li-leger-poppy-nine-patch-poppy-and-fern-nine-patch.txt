Focusing solely on the decorative element gradually reveals that there is a full landscape distributed between the parts of whole. Interestingly, the mood makes itself felt even without a visual reconstruction; the general impression is of an autumnal, warm day progressing towards its end — a touch of romance and sadness with a large dose of warm optimism. The red of the flowers accords perfectly with the shades of brown, yellow and wine-red. The irregular form of the stems and the blooms enlivens the strict linear division. Ultimately, this painting relaxes and instills feelings of security because all elements complement each other without breaking into the other’s thematic territory.
The humorous part consists of the artist’s invitation to play tag and try and recreate a more coherent landscape. The thing is, I don’t think it’s possible — it seems as though the painter cheats a little, teasing the audience. The semblance of a game tricks the viewers to fix their gaze on the piece for a little longer than usual, and absorb all that warm welcoming energy. The somewhat confusing light square in the middle serves as a vacuum area that catches the viewer’s attention, which then would be diffused between the peripheral squares. Eventually, this central “point of entry” gives the piece its edge: it keeps the color scheme slightly off-balance and reminds us that this is an abstract work of art after all.
