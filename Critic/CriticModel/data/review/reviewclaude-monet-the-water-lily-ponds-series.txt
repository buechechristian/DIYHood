In a series of works depicting his garden at Giverny, Monet exploits these water qualities to a full extent. The artist paints a pond that is covered in floating lilies, overlooked by a Japanese bridge, and surrounded by lush vegetation, all reflected. It is a setting that could be mistaken for a primordial jungle had the arching wooden structure not revealed signs of cultivation.
Mirrored trees and surface-bound lilies create a complex visual grid: interspersed one with the other, they produce an “inverted sky” effect, where islands of blooms act as clouds. In comparison, the actual sky in the Poplar series presents a much more restrained, sobering opposite — air has more space to move around, change, and “breathe;” here water absorbs everything insatiably, displaying a saturated, static view. Indeed, if it were not for the underlying sense of elegance and refinement that’s more akin to Gallic (Japanese inspired) rather than African vision of nature, these scenes would appear menacing.
An important motif that lends the paintings some dynamic becomes the vista. It opens up before the viewers, coils idly, and lures again and again — into Monet’s magical world.
