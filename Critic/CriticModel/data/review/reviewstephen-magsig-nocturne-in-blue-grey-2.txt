Strategically dispersed points of light, shimmering and glowing, assure that this almost completely monochromatic vision has, in fact, a life on the inside. The artist places the bulk of the plant slightly to the right of the center: the composition unfolds from left to right, literally peaking at the highest point of the structure, the crimson dot of the tallest chimney.
