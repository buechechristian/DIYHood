In many ways, this piece is all about contrasts. 
It makes sense that these houses appear so small — for the artist, they indeed were small. What was big for him — the universal questions about life, death and God, and how they all relate to each other — was depicted in appropriate cosmic proportions; the stars and how they came to be often allude to these questions. The artist expressed his world view on this canvas, making it a brooding, philosophical work of art.
Yet another contrast is that of nature and the city, of the untamed and the civilized. It is well demonstrated by the opposition of the tree in the foreground to the church on the outskirts of the town. This contrast may also be seen as the manifestation of the artist’s personal conflict with the religious institution, ensuing from his personal experience. After all, he failed as a clergyman, largely due to his rebellious and uncompromising character.
