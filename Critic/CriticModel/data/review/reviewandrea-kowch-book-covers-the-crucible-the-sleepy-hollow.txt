 We witness a sensitivity on the artist’s part: she steps back to allow the written narrative to have its word. The paintings are a part of a bigger design; each is the first frame of a long series of frames — which, perhaps, should be more aptly called pages, or chapters. The painter participates in a teamwork with the writer (and the publisher), bearing responsibility for the first impression and visual imprint. This is a risky enterprise, because some people will decide whether to read the book or not on the basis of the cover, despite the common saying. Considering the classic texts, it is also an overwhelming one — but not enough to confuse the artist, who produced vivid and effective visual introductions that match up to the written content.
