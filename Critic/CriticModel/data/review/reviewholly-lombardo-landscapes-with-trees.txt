 
There is a compositional rigor to it all: the paintings carefully balance chaos with calm by clear-cut borders. First, sharp angles between various tree parts generate a sense of urgency and aggression while the woods seem to move and expand, as the general upward direction indicates. Second, all these movements and threats are either pruned by the frame or carefully contained by the trees themselves: the  branches aim at the local center of the piece (where the trees concentrate) or above, where they collide and in a way neutralize each other. Finally, bordering trunks (or lowest branches) enwrap the entire display and isolate it from the rest of the piece,  proving how harmless the show really is.
Thus the paintings are divided into compositional segments, more violent ones including criss crossing lines and sharp edged triangles and the quiet ones consisting of wavy patches of snow or curved lines contouring a forest or a river bank. It is interesting that snow, after melting, turns into water which in turn would feed the trees and put on a coat of leaves on them. Trees with foliage — trolls appeased with mead — are no longer menacing. A scene in the painting above, where the river water divides (or in fact connects) between the woods visually foreshadows this paradigm. Eventually, the trolls get their mead — and we get our story.
