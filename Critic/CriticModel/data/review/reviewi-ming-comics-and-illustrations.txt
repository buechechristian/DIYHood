Because Ming’s comics contain so much neutral space, the few lines that express the  protagonist’s thoughts or the artist’s commentary (and sometime it is difficult to distinguish between the two) have the visual expanse to reverberate and seep into the reader’s mind. Additionally, they provide an inside glance into the artist’s verbal way of thinking, which for some may be the more accessible one. I almost compulsively start guessing what would he say about his paintings, to elucidate or reinterpret the title.
