The focus on a geometrical shape proves that these works are firstly abstract, secondly figurative. The irises themselves serve an auxiliary role of a thematic foil, which the audience sees through the stained-glass window squares.
There is one characteristic which, depending on individual taste, may prove to be somewhat tiresome. The cross shapes contribute to a certain symmetry â€” which may feel oppressive after awhile. The artist solves this problem in other variations, the Orchid Nine Patch (print below) being an example of blissful imbalance that nevertheless retains the cross.  It seems as though the artist was hesitant to go all abstract in the Irises and compensated for his irresolution by taking more risks in the Orchids. Eventually the abstract tendencies prevail over the flowers as the true experimental subject matter of the series.
