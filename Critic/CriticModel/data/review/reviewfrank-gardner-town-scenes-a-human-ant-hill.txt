The massive walls overlook the small figures yet, somehow, seem sleepy and appeased (at the first glance), as if exhausted by the sun. The buildings resemble giants — though I would not necessarily vouch for their gentleness. They store a lot of energy, and it’s unclear how it could erupt, if at all, and for what reason. I think that eventually this indeterminacy and lack of will emphasize human control and domination. Indeed, the architectural motif of the building in the piece you see below, if personified, would appear subservient: imitating the paws of a giant sphinx, with claws retracted before the walking woman, or a face with its gaze directed downward, in an expression of obedience.
To sum up, a few words (more in the following reviews) on Frank Gardner’s style. His choices of sometimes very surprising locations and edgy, unconventional compositions that produce unexpected geometrical shapes, labyrinths or heavily unbalanced configurations, they all point to high painterly confidence. Original viewing angles reveal a master whose foremost skill may lie in identifying the best location for his next painting, at least when working en plein air. Often I feel as if presented with an object or a theme from the side of the tail rather than of the head — a creative attitude that signifies a fresh approach, one which apparently became the norm for the artist.
