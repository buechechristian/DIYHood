Once again there is the temptation to try and guess the meaning of the colors, especially because most of them actually do not invite a straightforward likeness to something familiar. While the green and the blue parts most probably allude to a marine background, the yellowish-beige and the dark red seem indecipherable, and almost enigmatic. One reminds of sand and hot sun, but may just as well depict water under different lighting. The other projects a strong dusky vibe, but may in fact represent a part of an interior, which in turn would denote the flowers as still life! The artist tests his color formula in a different setting — harsh conditions — and proves its effectiveness once more.
